# tech-blog

## Description

Tech Blog is a way for users to post and comment on the tech world. They are able to login and create an account so they can create posts and add comments to other peoples posts. It allows for a community within the tech world. 

I was able to demonstrate what I have learned throughout the Carleton University Full Stack Coding Bootcamp as well as use my researching skills to determine how the different technologies used within the program works to complete the tasks I needed it to, as well as troubleshoot bugs that came up.
